The majority of abandoned vehicles, scofflaw vehicles and cars that are towed as a result of an accident or police activity are taken to the Main Impound Storage Facility. Vehicles that are illegally parked along major city gateways during peak hours (rush hour) are placed at the Fallsway lot for up to 48 hours. If the vehicle is not retrieved from the facility within 48 hours, it is then moved to the Pulaski Highway lot where storage fees may be assessed. Vehicles remaining at the Fallsway facility by the close of business each Friday will also be moved to Pulaski Highway.;56;07/29/2020 10:06:00 PM +0000;09/14/2020 10:00:00 AM +0000;Transportation;vehicle,dot,trasportation,tow,towing,impound,storage;49;Open Baltimore;;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported;published;;;Department of Transportation;;;https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/bm2i-kkw6.json;;;Daily;https://transportation.baltimorecity.gov/;;6r9a-dfdj;;;;;;;;;;;Baltimore City Department of Transportation;Baltimore City DOT;Automated Refresh;OpenBaltimore@baltimorecity.gov;https://transportation.baltimorecity.gov;;official;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Storm surge zones have been developed for category 1-4 hurricanes represented by the Saffir-Simpson Scale. The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. The SLOSH MOM data is utilized. MOM is the ""Maximum of Maximum or ""Meows Of Meows"". MOM output represents the highest water level or the ""worst case scenario"" for the entire Slosh basin.";504;05/16/2013 02:15:00 PM +0000;02/06/2017 04:52:00 AM +0000;Geographic;;24;PAScent;;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported;published;;;US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District;;;https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/g73b-dmav.json;;;;http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/;;dnn2-kig9;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Storm surge zones have been developed for category 1-4 hurricanes represented by the Saffir-Simpson Scale. The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. The SLOSH MOM data is utilized. MOM is the ""Maximum of Maximum or ""Meows Of Meows"". MOM output represents the highest water level or the ""worst case scenario"" for the entire Slosh basin.";519;05/16/2013 02:12:00 PM +0000;02/06/2017 04:51:00 AM +0000;Geographic;;36;PAScent;;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported;published;;;US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District;;;https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/ea2j-9f6q.json;;;;http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/;;dnn2-kig9;;;;;;;;;;;Non-Governmental;;;;;;community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These citations are not reported to insurance companies and no license points are assigned. Notification signs will be placed at all speed enforcement locations so that motorists will be aware that they are approaching a speed check zone. The goal of the program is to make the streets of Baltimore safer for everyone by changing aggressive driving behavior. In addition to the eight portable speed enforcement units, the city has retrofitted 50 red light camera locations with the automated speed enforcement technology.;628;05/16/2013 01:26:00 PM +0000;04/03/2014 11:24:00 PM +0000;Transportation;speed,transportation,citation;207;j;;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported;published;;;Department of Transportation;;;https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/wrwx-txk5.json;;;;http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/SpeedMonitoringLocations.aspx;;u8e9-nbfx;;;;;;;;;;;Baltimore City Department of Transportation;;;;;;community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. The SLOSH MOM data is utilized. MOM is the ""Maximum of Maximum or ""Meows Of Meows"". MOM output represents the highest water level or the ""worst case scenario"" for the entire Slosh basin.";1,582;10/29/2012 02:51:00 PM +0000;02/06/2017 04:49:00 AM +0000;Geographic;storm,hurricane,inundation zone;1,31;Open Baltimore;;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported;published;;;US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District;;;https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/vanx-ubga.json;;;;http://www.nab.usace.army.mil/;;6r9a-dfdj;;;;;;;;;;;Non-Governmental;;;;;;official;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, this is not a complete list. It is the most recent update (2008), and is subjected to change. The purpose of this data set is to aid Baltimore City organizations to best identify facilities to aid the homeless population. The data is broken down into two categories: Emergency Shelter and Transitional Housing. Please find the two definitions below. The first is simply ??_??_??_shelter??_?? and the second is a more involved program that is typically a longer stay. Emergency Shelter: Any facility with overnight sleeping accommodations, the primary purpose of which is to provide temporary shelter for the homeless in general or for specific populations of homeless persons. The length of stay can range from one night up to as much as six months. Transitional Housing: a project that is designed to provide housing and appropriate support services to homeless persons to facilitate movement to independent living within 24 months. These data set was provided by Greg Sileo, Director of the Mayor's Office of Baltimore Homeless Services.";1,503;10/23/2012 02:41:00 PM +0000;03/27/2014 11:52:00 PM +0000;Health;homeless,shelter;263;mdarty;;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported;published;;;Human Services / Homeless Services;;;https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/dmhe-byd7.json;;;;http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=1550;;it8u-cq98;;;;;;;;;;;Human Services;;;;;;community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Managed by the Planning Section, BikeBaltimore includes anything bike related including implementing the Bicycle Master Plan, incorporating cycling in many transportation projects, installing bike racks and coordinating cycling events. The Bicycle Master Plan was developed by the Department of Planning in 2006. With the implementation of the Bicycle Master Plan, more bike facilities are appearing on city streets. There are many different types of bike facilities. Bike Lane: an area designated for bike travel only. The bike lane is a 5??_?? wide lane with a bike symbol indicating that only bikes should use that lane, Sharrow: A roadway which is shared by bikes and automobiles. Cars should treat bikes as vehicles in the lane and pass when it is safe to do so, Signed Route: A roadway with no pavement markings, signed routes are used on low-traffic volume streets where cyclists can ??_??_??_take the lane??_??. Cars should pass bikes when it is safe to do so. Signed routes typically have mileage and destination markers with route adjustments along the way, Floating Bike Lane: Used along off-peak temporary parking, floating bike lanes adjust to the presence of parked cars. If parked cars are not present, cyclists occupy the 5??_?? bike lane along the curb. When parked cars are present, the cyclist travels in the designated area between the parked cars and vehicular travel lanes, Share The Road: When space does not exist for bike lanes, ??_??_??_SHARE THE ROAD??_?? signs are installed to remind motorists that cyclists may be present. Here cyclists are encouraged to use the shoulder of the road, or travel to the right while avoiding ??_??_??_door zones??_?? and roadside hazards, Shared Bus & Bike Lanes: On Pratt St, these lanes are only available to buses, bicycles and right turning vehicles;3,351;03/26/2012 12:30:00 PM +0000;04/03/2014 11:40:00 PM +0000;Transportation;bike lanes,bike,transportation;4,416;Open Baltimore;;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported;published;;;Department of Transportation;;;https://data.baltimorecity.gov/resource/xzfj-gyms.json;;;;http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/Planning/BikeBaltimore.aspx;;6r9a-dfdj;;;;;;;;;;;Baltimore City Department of Transportation;;;;;;official;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
